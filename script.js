// Now let's write a complex yet simple function which calculates area of a square, rectangle, triangle. 
// You think you can do it? Pause the video and try it yourself. 




function areaSq (side){
    return side * side ;
}

console.log(`The area of the square with side 6 units is ${areaSq(6)}`);

// Finish the completing the code for the following and the log the results as done above. 


function areaRec (l,b) {
    
}

function areaTriangle () {

}
