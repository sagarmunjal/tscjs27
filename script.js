// Writing basic functions in Javascript. 
// However, before we continue let's understand few basic concepts. 


// Let's begin writing functions which involve basic arithmatic operations like Addition, Subtraction, Division, Multiplication. 


function sum (a,b){
    return a+b;
}

console.log(`The sum of 4 & 5 is ${sum(4,5)}`);

// Practice yourself 
// add the function body and log the results in next line seeing the above example. 

function product(a,b){

}

function sub (a,b){

}

function div(a,b) {

}
